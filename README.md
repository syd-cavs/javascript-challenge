# javascript-challenge

In this challenge, I opted to use the given index.html. I created the table within a function.  Then I created a function to run whenever a date is entered into the box and the button is clicked. 

I duplicated the files from level 1 into level 2. I started by updating the index.html file to include search bars for the other categories and making sure the floating default text corresponded to a value in the table.  Next I made variables to select any text changes from these boxes and wrote if statements so that the filter could be applied.  The filter works inclusively if more than one filter are enabled at a time.
